// normal react client component with useEffect
// hook where we call an api and we made a async await function
// inside it, whereas in user-server folder we are making
// a rsc component (react server component)
// where we can use the async await directly in the
// componeny nextjs app router allows this

//suprised to know that nextjs will automatically use loading
// file and error file to show loading and handle error for server component
// where as we need to handle them manually in client side
